# 👋 Hello, I'm Thomas

## 🚀 Cloud Engineer & Tech Lead

I'm a passionate cloud architect and software developer specializing in **Microsoft Azure** and the **.NET ecosystem**. With deep expertise in cloud-native solutions, I help organizations leverage Azure's full potential while building robust, scalable applications using modern .NET technologies.

❌ Struggling to manage the increasing complex landscape of IT? I'm the right person to help improve your team's effectiveness by adding value and going beyond the regular day to day duties of a Cloud Engineer. I have 16 years of all round IT expertise in the design, implementation and management of scalable cloud infrastructure and workload applications in the commercial sector (SME, Enterprise).

Are you in desperate need for one of these improvements?
- building future proof software that performs well in a distributed environment (Software Architecture, Testing, Automation, DevOps)
- leveraging AI/LLM technologies to increase production rate while managing the associated risks and cost (AI Governance, AI Agents)
- helping new hires implement their first bugfix or feature on their first day (DevEx)
- deploying to production more frequently (DevSecOps, CI/CD)
- managing Cloud infrastructure in a repeatable, automated, declarative, immutable way (Infrastructure as Code)
- reduce or get a grip on your Cloud cost (Well Architected Framework, FinOps)
- simplify your IT landscape, prevent working in silos across teams, centralizing and improving reusability (Platform Engineering)

Then I'm excited to learn more about your challenges and help your business get on the right track!

### Some of my achievements
- ✅ Built the foundational event-driven (total greenfield) backend platform for a startup, increasing their development velocity, enabling future proof expansion of features and enabled continuous integration and deployment of features (user value).
- ✅ Host Architecture Kata meetup sessions to help (potential) Software Architects practice their architecting skills in a safe, hands-on, collaborative environment.
- ✅ Developed the backend API's for native iOS/Android apps supporting a large business acquisition of an online auctions platform with 10.000+ active daily users and implemented security and performance improvements.
- ✅ Delivered a Business Intelligence platform with strict security requirements using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) in an Azure Landing Zone. Also improved the resilience and fault tolerance of application workloads by identifying potential bottlenecks.
- ✅ Reduced cloud cost by phasing out, refactoring and improving existing solutions in a Cloud Platform team in the context of a high data volume IoT (telemetry), near real-time data processing platform.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack
