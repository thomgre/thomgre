# Thomas Grendel

Cloud (Native) Engineer, working mainly with Azure, Linux, Kubernetes, .NET and Rust.

I'm a passionate cloud architect and software developer specializing in **Microsoft Azure**. With deep expertise in cloud-native solutions, I help organizations leverage Azure's full potential.

## Things I've Delivered For Clients
✅ Built the foundational event-driven (completely greenfield) microservices platform for a startup: increasing their development velocity, enabling future proof feature growth and enabled increased velocity through CI/CD and DevOps best practices.

✅ Developed the backend API's for native iOS/Android apps supporting a large business acquisition of an online auctions platform with 10.000+ active daily users and implemented security and performance improvements.

✅ Delivered a Business Intelligence platform with strict security requirements using Infrastructure as Code (Terraform) in an Azure Landing Zone. Also improved the resilience and fault tolerance of application workloads by identifying potential bottlenecks.

✅ Host Architecture Kata meetup sessions to enable (potential) Software Architects practice their architecting skills in a safe, hands-on, collaborative environment.

✅ Reduced cloud cost by phasing out, refactoring and improving existing solutions in a Cloud Platform team in the context of a high data volume IoT (telemetry), near real-time data processing platform.

## Featured Projects

### Sandbox

Kids play in sandbox to explore the physical and sensory world. In this repo I collect projects, scripts, code snippets, etc. I use for learning, exploring and gaining pragmatic experience.

### Architecture Kata Toolkit
https://github.com/thomgre/architecture-kata-toolkit

An architecture kata is a meetup/gathering to practice software architecture (skills) in a safe and risk free environment as a team.

This repository serves as a kit to get started hosting architecture kata sessions, featuring the steps to follow and reference material needed in one handy repo that you can clone and work from.

I've hosted architecture kata meetups and built this kit from experience.
